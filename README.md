# Average Execution Time

Created because I was tired of running the same code thousands of times to calculate the execution time in my Parallel Computing classes.

Calculates automatically the average execution time of given C program using the utility command "time".

The number of iterations and threads are specified at running time.

## Instalation
<ol>
    <li> Clone the repository: https://github.com/Theeeccoo/Average_Execution_Time.git </li>
    <li> Navigate to the project directory: `cd Average_Execution_Time` </li>
</ol>

## Usage
<ol>
    <li>Change the variables in the shell script (run.sh) to meet your needs.</li>

> ⚠️ Pay attention to paths and the name of the file that will be analyzed;

```
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh Number_Of_Iterations Number_Of_Threads    
```
<li> In the end of execution, your result will be printed in the terminal and in the output.txt file.  </li>
    
</ol>
